## SiteMap & Wireframe Presentation

In this project, I decided to do a luxury car dealership. Here is the SiteMap for the website:

## Explaining the Decisions

Here I will explain the decisions taken during the project. Firstly, I used basically 4 colors for the project. The main color is blue, but not a bright blue, used for the background, then there is a darker blue, used as a container for information, and also there is yellow and gray for the buttons. I’ve chosen those colors because they complement each other well and create a visually appealing contrast. The choice of using a main blue color for the background provides a calming and neutral base for the project. The darker blue used as a container for information likely serves to create a clear distinction between different sections or elements on the page, making the information stand out without being too overwhelming.

The inclusion of yellow and gray for the buttons can serve different purposes. Yellow often signifies energy, positivity, or attention, making it a good choice for buttons that require action or draw attention. Gray, being a neutral color, complements the other colors while providing a sense of balance and sophistication to the design.

Now I’m going to explain the position of the elements. The landing page I chose to have the text next to the image to use all the horizontal space of the screen, then on the cars site I used a grid so I could have all the cars in order no matter the size of the screen. And lastly on the About and the Links pages I used a vertical and centered design because I don’t think those pages need a very impressive design. And yes, all the pages on this project are responsive.

## Links & Resources Used

To create this project, apart from the resources mentioned in the first part, I used Bing Image Creator to create all the images that you see on the project. Also, for some of the text, as I think the text was not an important part of the project and I needed a lot of it, I used ChatGPT to generate some.
